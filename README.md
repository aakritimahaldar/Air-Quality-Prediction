## Overview
Air pollution forecasting is the application of science and technology to predict the composition of the air pollution in the atmosphere for a given location and time. Mainstream pollution prediction algorithms tend to utilize air quality index or PM2. 5 concentration to indicate pollution level.

The forecast may give the pollutant's concentration or the air quality index.

Countries and cities are given forecasts by state and local government organizations, as well as private companies like Airly, AirVisual, Aerostate, BreezoMeter, PlumeLabs, and DRAXIS that provide air pollution forecasts.
Air pollution forecasting can be done by coupling weather forecasting systems with chemical transport model and atmospheric dispersion modeling.

## Data Collection 

I just took the example of Bangalore city Air Quality data with help of web scraping.


## Random Forest

Recent studies have incorporated machine learning techniques such as neural networks, regressions, and random forests to achieve high accuracy but I tried the random forest and it gives the good result 

## Flask Framework
Flask is a micro web framework written in Python. It is classified as a microframework because it does not require particular tools or libraries. ... Extensions exist for object-relational mappers, form validation, upload handling, various open authentication technologies and several common framework related tools.

## Installation and Run
The Code is written in Python 3.9 If you don't have Python installed you can find it [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/). If you are using a lower version of Python you can upgrade using the pip package, ensuring you have the latest version of pip. To install the required packages and libraries, run this command in the project directory after [cloning](https://www.howtogeek.com/451360/how-to-clone-a-github-repository/) the repository:

Install Required Libraries

     Step 1: pip install -r requirements.txt
     
Running Project

     Step 2: Python app.py

## Technologies Used
python,pandas,numpy and flask
   
         
                            
## Tools / IDE
I used Jupyter NoteBook (Google Colab) for model training. used spyder for model deployment on the local system. To use Jupyter NoteBook and Spyder, just install anaconda.

Software Requirments
* Python == 3.7.7
* NumPy == 1.18.5
* Flask == 1.1.2
